# Introduction

This GitHub repo houses the code for a simple global financial markets dashboard used to guide discussion for the 15 minute *trading floor meeting* at the beginning of class each week for **Sustainable Finance: Applications and Methods** at [Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)](https://sais.jhu.edu/).

## Purpose

Financial markets are complex. The objective of this dashboard is to give readers a 40,000 ft view of global financial markets in as few indicators as possible. The dashboard seeks to:

1.  Avoid cognitive overload by focusing on only five indicators.

2.  Illuminate big-picture trends in global financial markets.

3.  Inform where readers might want to dig deeper.

The second purpose of the dashboard is to provide the class a practical example of how R (and other open-source tools) can be used to create automatable data products that save us time and help us make better decisions.

## Indicators

This dashboard focuses on five indicators central to global financial markets.

-   **Interest Rates**:

    -   Fed Funds Rate

    -   US 10-Year Treasury Yield

-   **Risk Assets**:

    -   S&P 500

-   **Commodities**:

    -   Oil Prices (Brent)

-   **Currencies**:

    -   Broad USD Index

# Reproducibility

The dashboard is made using open source tools ([R](https://www.r-project.org/) + [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) + [Plotly R](https://plotly.com/r/)). It uses freely available data from the [Federal Reserve (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/). The charts use the freely available [Roboto font from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) because it looks a lot more professional than the default fonts in Plotly.

You can fork this GitHub repository and you should be able to run & modify the code as you please.

# Work in Progress

This is a work in progress. Over time, I'll improve the dashboard, and add secondary dashboards that do a deeper dive into key asset classes.

Initial To-Dos:

-   **Clean up code**: I plan to clean up the code into well-annotated functions.

-   **Automate using GitHub Actions**: Using the [blogpost written by Bea Milz](https://beamilz.com/posts/series-gha/2022-series-gha-2-creating-your-first-action/en/), I've had initial success automating R scripts using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). I'd like to automate this dashboard to update daily or weekly. Work hard to be lazy.

-   **Adding secondary dashboards**: With dashboards, brevity is sacred. I want to keep the 40,000 ft dashboard as un-cluttered as possible. But I plan to add secondary dashboards that use publicly available data to dig in deeper on asset classes of interest.
