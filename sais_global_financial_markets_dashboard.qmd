### Set Range Selector Options for Plotly plots
# This code adds:
## makes the chart default to showing 1 year of data
## adds a range slider
## adds range selector buttons
## limits the chart to showing weekdays so that the lines don't show gaps for every weekend, as is the default for plotly.

  # makes 1 year the default view

  # makes the range slider visible

# Introduction

Financial markets are complex. The objective of this dashboard is to give readers a 40,000 ft view of global financial markets in as few indicators as possible. The dashboard seeks to:

1\. Avoid cognitive overload by focusing on only five indicators.

2\. Illuminate big-picture trends in global financial markets.

3\. Inform where readers might want to dig deeper.This dashboard is meant to anchor and inform the 15 minute trading floor meeting at the beginning of each class for **Sustainable Finance: Applications and Methods** at the [Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)](https://sais.jhu.edu/).

It is a work in progress, and will evolve & improve over time.
